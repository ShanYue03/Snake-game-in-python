## üêç Snake Game
A classic Snake game built using Python's turtle library. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming (OOP), game mechanics, and collision detection in a fun and interactive way.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
Snake Movement: Control the snake using arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right).

Food Collection: The snake grows longer when it eats food, which randomly appears on the screen.

Score Tracking: Keeps track of your score and updates it in real-time.

Collision Detection:

Detects collisions with walls, ending the game.

Detects collisions with the snake's own tail, ending the game.

Game Reset: The game resets when the snake collides with a wall or its tail, but the high score persists.

## üéÆ How It Works
Snake Movement: The snake moves continuously in the direction of the arrow keys.

Food Mechanics:

Food appears at random locations on the screen.

When the snake's head touches the food, the snake grows longer, and the score increases.

Collision Detection:

If the snake hits the wall or its own tail, the game resets.

Scoreboard:

Displays the current score.

Resets the score when the game restarts but keeps track of the high score.

## üß∞ Technologies Used
Python

turtle module for graphics and animations.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for modular and reusable code.
